## Intro

I'm a cybersecurity professional with over two years of experience in the field. My passion for technology extends beyond work—I continuously learn and experiment in my free time. I enjoy tackling CTF challenges, building homelab projects, and developing full-stack applications.

Recently, I've also discovered a love for reading and exploring new ideas through books. In my homelab, I self-host services that simplify and enhance daily life, including an e-book management system, a backup server, and other practical tools.

Driven by curiosity and a problem-solving mindset, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set.
