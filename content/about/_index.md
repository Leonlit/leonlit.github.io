I’m a cybersecurity professional with over two years of experience in the field. My passion extends beyond work—I’m constantly learning and experimenting with technology in my free time. I dive into CTF challenges, work on homelab projects, and develop full-stack applications.

Recently, I’ve also started to enjoy reading and exploring new ideas through books. In my homelab, I self-host various services to streamline and improve my life, like an e-book management system, a backup server, and other useful tools.

Overall, I’m always driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving.
